\chapter{Third Party Libraries Used}

\noindent Modulo7 is a significant software engineering effort.

\chapter{Algorithms is use in Modulo7}

\noindent There are certain algorithms in literature that are directly implemented in Modulo7. These algorithms facilitate the smooth functioning of Modulo7's indexing in face of incomplete metadata. Some notable algorithms that have been used are briefly described in the following subsections. 

\section{KK Tonality Profiles - Key Estimation}

\noindent Many music sources have the key signature inscribed in it. For example a midi file might have the key signature bytes transcribed.
