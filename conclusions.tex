\chapter{Conclusions}

\noindent In this thesis, a new Music Information Retrieval system is proposed and implemented which applies concepts of music theory for structured querying and search based on domain specific similarity measures. \\

\noindent The goals that Modulo7 was able to accomplish can be stated as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item To implement an space efficient and universal indexing scheme for variegated sources of music 
\item To implement and expose querying language and a search engine functionality which uses music theoretic criteria
\item To implement a lyrics analyzer to support lyrics similarity  
\item To explore and quantify the efficiency and efficacy of applying music theoretic concepts for similarity judgments and querying.
\end{enumerate}
