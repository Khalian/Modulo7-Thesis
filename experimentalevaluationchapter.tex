\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

\noindent For the purposes of evaluating Modulo7, test cases have been designed into two formats. One category of testing is micro testing, for validating correctness and precision recall for small sets of data. This ensures verifiability of algorithms and similarity measures on small datasets as well as novel explorations of data. Most MIR research is done on small scale datasets and hence falls in the purview of micro testing. The other format is macro testing which involves large datasets such as the million song dataset \cite{msd}. \\\\
A few assumptions that are made in testing are as follows :-
\begin{enumerate}

\item In order to estimate ground truth values, the author assumed ground truth values presented in datasets used / or subjective judgments about which songs are similar to each other. These subjective judgments are procured from existing literature.
\item If the song meta data (such as key-signature, time-signature, total duration of song) is not encoded, its estimated by the individual parsers for the data source. This estimation id done by existing algorithms in literature. However if meta data is encoded in the input, its assumed to be correct and no such estimations are carried out. 
\item Most tests are against file formats of the similar types (for example midi is tested against other symbolic files). This is due to the inherent complexity of symbolic decoding of audio formats like mp3. Also its easier to compare symbolic data against other symbolic data.
\item In the event of parsing data, there can be legal issues (e.g. the song can be copyrighted). For that reason custom parsers to build alternate research datasets (e.g the million song dataset has already derived features that Modulo7 intended to derive for Mp3 files and has its own parser written by the authors. \cite{msd})
\item All evaluations are done against research datasets which are published in academia or exposed as public data sets in industry. As such no proprietary data sets are used for the purpose of evaluation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results of Index Compression}

\noindent The Modulo7 representation can be thought of an indexed meta data version of the song. True to all indexed data, Modulo7 represents the song in a much smaller size than the original source. The following chart demonstrates the average compression of indexed data as compared to source files on the Saarland Music Data (SMD) Dataset \cite{saarlandmsd}:-

\end{figure}
As expected Modulo7's serialized format expresses a song in less disk space than its source formats while keeping the symbolic information intact. The results are positive as there is a 4 time decrease in size of expressing symbolic information as compared to midi files. \\\\
A similar transformation was also done on a direct downloadable subset of the wikifonia dataset in order to compare Modulo7 internal representation against normal 

\section{Result on Memory and Disk space \\ usage}

\noindent In order to compare the memory and disk space requirements, Modulo7 was tested against its closest competitor jMIR's \cite{jMIR} jSymbolic component. Both frameworks are written in Java and both involve extraction of features. However jMIR is more exhaustive in what features it extracts so only a subset of those that are also extracted by Modulo7 are considered. 

\section{Results on similarity measures}

\noindent This set of experiments determine the precision and recall values for the similarities defined in \ref{similarity} on ground truth data extracted from \cite{msd}. Modulo7 does not claim to improve on the state of the art when it comes to similarity metrics or does not intend to create a new similarity metric. Rather this set of experiments are a test of efficiency in execution and accuracy of existing methods on large scale datasets. The following tests are conducted as part of the benchmarking:-

\begin{enumerate}
\item Benchmarks are done against the SIMILIE software stack \cite{similie} after taking into account the inherent speed difference between R\cite{similietechnicalmanual} and Java for specific melodies
\item The state of the art similarity measures for melodies are generalized to polyphonic music and tested against newer datasets like \cite{msd} to ascertain recall and precision values
\item 
\end{enumerate}  

\section{Results on KK Tonality Profiles algorithm}

\noindent In order to test the KK Tonality algorithm given in \ref{kktonality}, Modulo7 is benchmarked against a big subset of the Wikifonia data set of lead sheets in the compact mxl format (variant of the music xml format) \cite{WikifoniaDataset}. The original dataset of the Wikifonia is now no longer available but a sizable subset of 6715 songs are currently downloadable and copyright free. Out of this set, 1314 have key signatures embedded in the song sources. The experiment involves comparing the key signatures embedded inside the key signatures versus the implied key signatures the KK Tonality estimates from the pitch histogram of the songs parsed from this source. A special MXL parser (a minor variant of the music xml parser) was developed for this purpose. The scoring scheme for this experiment was simple, if the key signature was correctly identified then score of 1 otherwise score of 0. In this particular dataset, key signatures are partially known (\textbf{since the number of sharps or flats in the key signatures are always encoded in music xml files} so only relative major/minor are needed to be ascertained). As a consequence only two choices are to be made between key signatures for each file giving a baseline of 50 percent. In this particular example, KK Tonality's performance is how well it can distinguish between relative minors and majors. \\\\
After running the KK Tonality algorithm on the wikifonia dataset, 1129 out the total 1314 key signatures are correctly identified leading to an accuracy of \text{85.9 percent}. This is commensurate with the reported accuracies in \cite{kkTonalityKeyFinding}. The novelty of this experiment stems from the fact that KKTonality profiles algorithm was not successfully run against a large database successfully before.  

\section{Results on lyrics similarity and statistics analysis}

\noindent On top of the experiments done for Song sources incorporating tonal information, there were specific experiments that were carried out for lyrics similarities in general. The ground truth for these experiments is the musix match lyrics dataset present in the million song data set \cite{msd}. The dataset decomposes lyrics into bag of words formats (the frequencies of the top 5000 words in lyrics) along with bag of words representation of 210,519 lyrics of songs. This dataset acts like a great baseline for set based similarities of lyrics. The experiment involved calculating the expected word count from the ground truth data and with that form a basis for comparing songs with the ground truth data. There are measures defined in literature \cite{lyricsRanking} which define similarity and accuracy of lyrics based on expected counts of words and observed counts of words in lyrics. However for this experiment we have decided to extract the tags from the last fm dataset of the Million Song Data set \cite{msd} to acquire the tags that occur frequently for a given song and then build a predictive model that outputs the tags for a newly seen song. \\\\
These tags could indicate the language, genre etc of the songs. As such this comparison allows for predicting various meta data regarding a newly seen lyric cs of a song. \\\\
Consider $T(S_i)$ be defined as  the set of tags for the $S_i$ which is the $i^{th}$ song in the music match dataset. Let $S_{new}$ be a new song for which tags need to be predicted and get L(S) represent the lyrics of a song. Hence $L_{new}$ should be similar to some $L(S_k)$ for their tags to be similar. Let $S_{sim} = {S_i | isSim(S_i, S_new) = true} $ be the set of all the songs similar to $S_new$. We define $T_{new} = \{\cup \ T(S_i) \ | \ S_i \in S_{sim}\}$. In other words the tags of the new song is the union of the tags in the songs similar to the new song. This method is called the \textbf{naive tag estimation}. \\\\
This method does not capture the strength of similarity a song has to another.
