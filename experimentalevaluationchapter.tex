\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

\noindent For the purposes of evaluating Modulo7, test cases have been designed into two formats. One category of testing is micro testing, for validating correctness and precision recall for small sets of data. This ensures verifiability of algorithms and similarity measures on small datasets as well as novel explorations of data. Most MIR research is done on small scale datasets and hence falls in the purview of micro testing. The other format is macro testing which involves large datasets such as the million song dataset \cite{msd}. \\\\
A few assumptions that are made in testing are as follows :-\\
