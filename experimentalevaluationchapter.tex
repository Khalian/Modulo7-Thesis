\chapter{Experimental Evaluation}

\noindent For the purposes of evaluating Modulo7, test cases have been designed into two formats. One category of testing is micro testing, for validating correctness and precision recall for small sets of data. This ensures verifiability of algorithms and similarity measures on small datasets as well as novel explorations of data. Most MIR research is done on small scale datasets and hence falls in the purview of micro testing. The other format is macro testing which involves large datasets such as the million song dataset \cite{msd}. \\\\
A few assumptions that are made in testing are as follows :-
\begin{enumerate}
\item In order to estimate ground truth values, the author assumed ground truth values presented in datasets used / or subjective judgments about which songs are similar to each other. These subjective judgments are procured from existing literature.
\item If the song meta data (such as key-signature, time-signature, total duration of song) is not encoded, its estimated by the individual parsers for the data source. This estimation id done by existing algorithms in literature. However if meta data is encoded in the input, its assumed to be correct and no such estimations are carried out. 
\item Most tests are against file formats of the similar types (for example midi is tested against other symbolic files). This is due to the inherent complexity of symbolic decoding of audio formats like mp3. Also its easier to compare symbolic data against other symbolic data.
\item In the event of parsing data, there can be legal issues (e.g. the song can be copyrighted). For that reason custom parsers to build alternate research datasets (e.g the million song dataset has already derived features that Modulo7 intended to derive for Mp3 files and has its own parser written by the authors. \cite{msd})
\item All evaluations are done against research datasets which are published in academia or exposed as public data sets in industry. As such no proprietary data sets are used for the purpose of any evaluation metric.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results of Index Compression}

\noindent The Modulo7 representation can be thought of an indexed meta data version of the song with the symbolic information of the song intact. True to all indexed data, Modulo7 represents the song in a much smaller size than the original source. The following chart demonstrates the average compression of indexed data as compared to source files on the Saarland Music Data (SMD) Dataset \cite{saarlandmsd}:-

\let\@currsize\normalsize
\caption{Modulo7 architectural design}
\label{fig:figure}
\end{figure}
As expected Modulo7's serialized format expresses a song in less disk space than its source formats while keeping the symbolic information intact. The results are positive as there is a 4 time decrease in size of expressing symbolic information as compared to midi files. \\\\
A similar transformation was also done on a direct download able subset of the wikifonia dataset in order to compare Modulo7 internal representation against the compressed xml representation of the wikifonia dataset. A plot of disk space requirements are plotted in ascending order of the wikifonia dataset file sizes:-

\end{figure}

\noindent As expected, Modulo7 is extremely space efficient for storing symbolic information.
\section{Results on similarity measures}

\noindent This set of experiments determine the precision and recall values for the similarities defined in \ref{similarity} on ground truth data extracted from \cite{msd}. Modulo7 does not claim to improve on the state of the art when it comes to similarity metrics or does not intend to create a new similarity metric. Rather this set of experiments are a test of efficiency in execution and accuracy of existing methods on large scale datasets. The million song dataset was chosen for experimental evaluation \cite{msd} for pre computed symbolic transcriptions of mp3 data and the last fm data set for ascertaining similar songs to build a ground truth for evaluation. Due to the constraints of hardware for evaluation, we took a scaled down subset of the original 584,897 songs to a more manageable 10000 songs, with similar songs edited to fit this dataset. The songs were chosen randomly from the dataset with the only criteria being that they are monophonic(since polyphonic transcription from audio files is not a fully solved problem \cite{melextract}). As a consequence only the monophonic similarity measures are used for these experiments. 

\section{Results on KK Tonality Profiles algorithm}

\noindent In order to test the KK Tonality algorithm given in \ref{kktonality}, Modulo7 is benchmarked against a big subset of the Wikifonia data set of lead sheets in the compact mxl format (variant of the music xml format) \cite{WikifoniaDataset}. The original dataset of the Wikifonia is now no longer available but a sizable subset of 6715 songs are currently down loadable and copyright free. Out of this set, 1314 have key signatures embedded in the song sources. The experiment involves comparing the key signatures embedded inside the key signatures versus the implied key signatures the KK Tonality estimates from the pitch histogram of the songs parsed from this source. A special MXL parser (a minor variant of the music xml parser) was developed for this purpose. The scoring scheme for this experiment was simple, if the key signature was correctly identified then score of 1 otherwise score of 0. In this particular dataset, key signatures are partially known (\textbf{since the number of sharps or flats in the key signatures are always encoded in music xml files} so only relative major/minor are needed to be ascertained). As a consequence only two choices are to be made between key signatures for each file giving a baseline of 50 percent. In this particular example, KK Tonality's performance is how well it can distinguish between relative minors and majors. \\\\
After running the KK Tonality algorithm on the wikifonia dataset, 1129 out the total 1314 key signatures are correctly identified leading to an accuracy of \text{85.9 percent}. This is commensurate with the reported accuracies in \cite{kkTonalityKeyFinding}. The novelty of this experiment stems from the fact that KKTonality profiles algorithm was not successfully run against a large scale database successfully in literature. 

\section{Results on lyrics similarity and genre estimation}

\noindent On top of the experiments done for Song sources incorporating tonal information, there were specific experiments that were carried out for lyrics similarities in general. The ground truth for these experiments is the musix match lyrics dataset present in the million song data set \cite{msd}. The dataset decomposes lyrics into bag of words formats (the frequencies of the top 5000 words in lyrics) along with bag of words representation of 210,519 lyrics of songs. This dataset acts as baseline for set based similarities of lyrics. The experiment involved calculating the expected word count from the ground truth data and with that form a basis for comparing songs with the ground truth data. There are measures defined in literature \cite{lyricsRanking} which define similarity and accuracy of lyrics based on expected counts of words and observed counts of words in lyrics. However for this experiment we have decided to extract the genre labels from the tag tratum genre annotations dataset of the Million Song Data set \cite{msd} to acquire the genre labels that are observed for a given song and then build a predictive model that outputs genre labels for a newly seen song. \\\\
Out of the 210,519 songs with lyrics provided in the million song data set and 280,831 songs with corresponding genre labels annotated, 55726 songs were identified with both lyrics and genre labels present, so this set of songs are considered the ground truth for estimating genre labels for novel lyrics. The lyrics in this dataset are in the bag of words document representation format and hence standard set based similarity measures like cosine and dice similarity can be used for comparing lyrics. The lyrics in the million song dataset are already stemmed via the Porter stemmer \cite{msd}  so no explicit stemming is conducted as a part of this experiment.\\\\
In order to estimate the accuracy of the tag prediction models, the extracted data was divided into 10 percent test data and 90 percent training data and 10 fold cross validation was performed. Each lyrics in the test data was compared to the training data and a ranked order of the trained songs are presented based on the similarity metric used. Tags are then estimated based on the tag estimation mechanisms presented in \ref{genreestimation}. \\\\
Parameters which determines the degree of permissible agreement are the thresh hold value $\epsilon$ defined in \ref{NaiveGenre} and \ref{MaxFrequencyGenre} and top k songs chosen in \ref{WeightedGenre} and \ref{MaxFrequencyGenre}. For the purposes of experimental evaluation, these hyper parameters were manually tweaked and the most optimal configuration is presented. \\\\
\noindent The following table lists out the observed average precision and recall values over all songs of the test set after 10 fold cross validation:- \\

\section{Result on Memory and Disk space usage against jMIR}

\noindent In order to compare the memory and disk space requirements, Modulo7 was tested against its closest competitor jMIR's \cite{jMIR} jSymbolic component. Both frameworks are written in Java and both involve extraction of features(although that is not an end goal for Modulo7). However jMIR is more exhaustive in what features it extracts so only a subset of those that are also extracted by Modulo7 are considered. Out of the total 111 features that are implemented in jSymbolic \cite{jSymbolic}, 23 features were identified as implemented as internal computation within the Modulo7 indexers and/or querying engine. \textbf{Its important to note that unlike jMIR, Modulo7 is not an exhaustive feature extractor}. The features identified  
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1 feature for duration of song
\item 2 features for average melodic intervals, note duration
\item 1 feature for Meter classification (simple or compound)
\item 1 feature for lengths of melodic archs in midi files
\item 1 feature for initial tempo of song
\item 4 features for melodic intervals (thirds, fifths, octaves and intervals in the bass line)
\item 2 features for maximum and minimum durations of notes in the song
\item 3 features for most commonly occurring pitch, pitch class and melodic interval
\item 3 features for ranges, namely primary register, range of highest and lowest voices
\item 1 feature for time signature
\item 4 features for checking for voice equality in the following categories : melodic leaps, note duration, number of notes and range
\end{enumerate}
\noindent In order to compare the frameworks, the author used jProfiler to profile for average CPU and Memory usage and time taken for both frameworks over different sized subsets of the Saarland Music Data (SMD) Dataset \cite{saarlandmsd}. In order to protect against background process interference, the frameworks were ran on AWS EC2 m4x.large instances (dual core 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon® E5-2676 v3 (Haswell) processors
and 8 GB DDR3 RAM). We plot the average memory consumed, CPU load and time taken in seconds as a function of dataset size (over monotonically increasing subset sizes of the SMD dataset). We ignore IO performance since in this experiment, IO is only utilized when pushing output to disk, which is not taken as a metric of evaluation. No data sets involving music xml files were chosen, as jSymbolic does not support music xml files.

\newpage

\noindent From these graphs we can conclude the following :-

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modulo7 is much faster than jSymbolic when computing core features and both of them scale linearly. The rate of increase for Modulo7 is lower, and hence Modulo7 scales better for larger datasets as compared to jSymbolic.
\item jSymbolic under utilizes CPU for computing features whereas Modulo7 is optimal in terms of CPU usage.
\item jSymbolic consumes more Java Heap memory during execution on average. 
\end{enumerate}
