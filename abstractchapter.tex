\begin{abstract}

\noindent Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is an interdisciplinary science of extracting non trivial information and statistics from music data sources. In today's digital age, music is stored in a variety of digitized formats - e.g midi, musicxml, mp3, digitized sheet music etc. Music Information Retrieval Software aim at extracting features from one or more of these source. MIR research helps in solving problems like automatic music classification, recommendation engine design etc. Users can then query the acquired statistics to acquire relevant information. \\\\
The author proposes and implements a new Music Information Retrieval and Query Engine called Modulo7. Unlike other MIR software which deal with low level audio features, Modulo7 operates on the principles of music theory and a symbolic representation of music. Modulo7 is a full stack deployment, with server components that parse various sources of music data into its own efficient internal representation and a client component that allows consumers to query the system with sql like queries which satisfies certain music theory criteria (and as a consequence Modulo7 has a custom relational algebra with its basic building blocks based on music theory).

\begin{acknowledgment}

\noindent I would like to thank Dr David Yarowsky for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. His detailed insights have immensely helpful to me to power through my work and to also make the technical depth of the project accessible to laymen. I would like to thank Dr Yanif Ahmad for his crucial help in the systems aspects of my query engine and the implementation of the server side components. I would like to thanks Natalie Draper in the Peabody Conservatory, my instructor for music theory for teaching me the basics of music theory. I would like to thank Dr Cory Mckay from McGill University for his help with understanding concepts in symbolic music Information Retrieval and help with implementation specifics for symbolic retrieval. I would like to thank Dr Ichiro Fuginaga from McGill University for his guidance and help with Optical Music Recognition concepts. \\\\
I would like to thank my friends Aakash, Ankit, Satya and Japneeth for their support, help with technical and coding aspects of the project. \\\\
Most importantly I would like to thanks my family for their unending support, and for instilling a love for music which has allowed me to take this in depth study of application of Computer Science to Music theory.
