\noindent Why does a person like a particular song? What are the inherent aspects of a song that pleases a person's musical taste? Is it the complexity of a song, the beat the song or just a particular melodic pattern ? More so if a person likes a song, can we predict if he/she will like a similar song? \\\\
Music has been created since the dawn of civilization and these questions have plagued mankind just as long. In response to this, man has created elaborate systems of formal study for music and classification techniques in almost every ethnic community since antiquity. Two notable examples are the western system of solfege and classical music theory and the Indian system of raagas. These elaborate systems are based on very simple fundamental building blocks of melody and harmony and simple rules that govern the interplay of these building blocks. However very complex pieces of music can be created with these simple rules depending on the skill and virtuosity of artists. Composers use these rules and concepts to create novel music for mass consumption. \\\\
In the modern era industry and academia have attempted to address the problem of music recommendation and music classification. The industry has predominantly favored approaches that look at user preferences and history. For example Amazon Music recommendation works on users shopping history. Pandora on the other hand utilizes musicologists to ascertain how a song is similar to another song and creates software that leverages this adhoc generated data \cite{musicgenomepandora}. These approaches are either expensive in the human labor needed or in the amount of data processed that is input from a large number of users. More recently, companies like Echo Nest has extensively extracted features from music sources \cite{echonestfingerprint} and mined cultural information on the web but leave it at consumers how best to leverage the data. Hence symbolic MIR is not traditionally used in industry and music theory is an after thought in almost all industry applications. \\\\
Academia on the other hand attempts to solve very particular problems in MIR. Typical examples would be cover song detection, processing information via signal processing, audio feature extraction, optical music recognition etc. In most cases the applications are of a very specific domain and does not fully scale with bulk music data. Generic frameworks like the jMIR \cite{jMIR} (which also happens to be a major inspiration for Modulo7) suite for automatic music classification exists, which is meant to facilitate research in MIR with a machine learning focus. However academia is disconnected with industry and no full scale MIR engines can satisfy the scale of industry applications. \\\\
This work is attempt to bridge both communities. Modulo7 is a full stack deployment of Music Information Retrieval Software, providing both a server architecture and a sql like client to query based on music theory criteria. Modulo7 is and information retrieval framework to explore the possibilities of exploring music theoretical aspects of music sources. Modulo7 does not attempt to solve very complex music theoretic problems (e.g study orchestral music to identify counter point information). Rather Modulo7 acts a framework on which such analysis can be built upon. Most importantly, Modulo7 addresses the issue of scale and allows a fast comparison between songs on certain music theoretic criteria. Modulo7 also acts to address deficiencies in existing software, such as filling up incompleteness in music sources. Certain problem statement of this sort would be Key estimation, Tempo estimation etc. \\\\
Modulo7 only includes a unique yet novel indexing scheme. This indexing scheme involves creating an inverted index for global properties of songs (key signature, homophonic, time signature etc) . This indexing scheme allows for fast lookups for certain types of queries (e.g find all songs that in the key of C Major) and also allows for speedup in scenarios which require criteria based on indexed terms.
